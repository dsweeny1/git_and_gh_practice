I chose to try and follow my passion by studying Contemporary Art History and Theory. As much as I love it the industry does not offer many career paths that allow you a well rounded life.
I have worked in retail and food service for many years now. Especially with the advent of Covid it is a career trajectory I am very ready to leave.
I want to change the structure of my life. I want a job that will afford me enough money to travel and to live fulfilled. Not just living to work because I have to eat.
